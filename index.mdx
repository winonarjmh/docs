- How do customers typically evaluate us against competitors or internal deal-breakers? 
- What does Mintlify define as a good piece of content? 
- What's our current martech stack, and are there any tool limitations I should know about?

  - Do we need to create a new page for all our templates/guides/tools? 
  - Do we need to update the nav to reflect these changes?
